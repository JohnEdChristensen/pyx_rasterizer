Live Demo: [Pyx Rasterizer](https://kitao.github.io/pyxel/wasm/launcher/?run=JohnEdChristensen.pyx_rasterizer.src.3D&gamepad=enabled&packages=numpy)

A triangle rasterizer using [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) as a graphics library.

The goal is to work our way up to what the graphics card does with triangles to render a 3D model. Quinten got to do this in a class in college and had so much fun, but always wanted to see what it would be like to reimplement in a fantasy console with low-res constraints. John wanted to better understand what goes on behind the scenes in 3D rendering, so we have joined forces! Working on this weekly has been a highlight of our Recurse Center batch.
